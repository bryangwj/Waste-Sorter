## Waste-Sorter
A computer vision model to allow waste-sorting machines to automatically classify the waste, henceforth streamlining the sorting process.

## Inspiration
People are often in a dilemma into whether a waste is recyclable. Having a machine that will be able to identify what category the waste belongs to is the first step to allowing the machine to properly sort it. This will lead to higher rates of recycling and help save the earth.

## What it does
Firstly, photos of the trash is captured via the webcam of the laptop. Ideally, the image taken from the webpage will be sent for classification by our machine learning model into 6 categories "Plastic, cardboard, glass, metal, paper and trash". Thereafter, the classification result will be displayed on the webpage to streamline the recycling process and increase efficiency.

## How we built it
We used Google Colab as the platform to write and train our machine learning model, using the keras framework.

## Challenges we ran into
We had trouble integrating our webpage with our python script.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our team managed to work cohesively and pick up the various technical skills quickly despite our lack of experience. 

## What's next for Waste Sorter
Introducing it as a potential solution for recycling plants to increase the efficiency of recycling by reducing the time taken to sort the waste into various recyclable materials.
